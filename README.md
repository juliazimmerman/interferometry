# Radio Interferometry Visibility Simulator

## Description
Python-based simulator that models radio interferometry. Centered around the Astropy package, it calculates time, location, and sky coordinates to compute the visibility from sources in the sky. The simulator uses many visibilities to calculate the resulting interference pattern.
